# Printing

```print("hello") - string
print(true) - boolean
print(3+3) (prints 6) - interger
```

# Variables

```Local Name1 = 7 (Name1 is the variable)
Print(Name1) (will print 7)
```

# Wait

```Wait(2) (waits 2 seconds)
```

# Properites

```local Part = game.Workspace.(name of part)

Part.Anchored = false (anchored is a property) (true and false can enable and disable it) (example: Part.Anchored = ture will make it anchored)

Part.BrickColor = BrickColor.new("name of color") (changes the brick color duh)
Part.BrickColor = BrickColor.Random() (random brick color)
```
